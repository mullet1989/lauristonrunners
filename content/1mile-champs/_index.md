There are no results found for 1970 or 1975 and we assume races were not held in those years.

The 1978 result was taken from the annual report for that year and is all the information available with the club records.

From approximately 1990 onwards the club championships were run in meetings kindly put on by other clubs and any non-member was allowed to take part but only

those with an LRC connection have been included in the results.

If you have any information about the missing results or other memories you would like to share, please contact webmaster@lauristonrunners.club
