Lauriston Runners Club is a training centre for men and women runners and retired runners who wish to walk for exercise.  
It is located at 6b Southside Wimbledon Common, London, SW19 4TG with the entrance on Lauriston Road.  
This is about a 400 yd walk from Wimbledon Village with bus stops from Putney and Wimbledon town.  

There are separate changing rooms, showers and toilet facilities for men and women, a small kitchen where runners can make tea and have a biscuit, a weights room and a library of books on running. The venue offers unparalleled scope for running across Wimbledon Common, Richmond Park and along the Thames tow path. The facilities are open twenty four hours a day, seven days a week, and members can have their own key and use when they like.
