Lauriston Runners Club operates from Lauriston Cottage, 6B Southside Common, London SW19 4TG.  The Clubâ€™s object is the encouragement of running and the Cottage is a training centre for men and women.

It is on the edge of Wimbledon Common and offers unparalleled scope for running across the Common, Richmond Park and more, including along the Thames towpath.  The facilities are open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and members can have their own key to be able to use the Cottage whenever they like.
