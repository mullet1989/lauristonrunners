Lauriston Runners Club was founded by Arthur Whitehead on 30th October 1966, and the premises were given to the Club, vested in four Trustees, in 1978.

Arthur had inherited the four cottages which were part of the premises of Lauriston House from his father, Sir Arthur Fell, who for many years was MP for Great Yarmouth.  Lauriston House was famous having been the home of William Wilberforce in the late 1700's.  When it was demolished in 1957 over twenty houses were built on its land.  But the cottages predate the house, having been in existence since before 1684.

Arthur had lived in the first cottage next to Southside Common since sometime after he was demobbed at the end of the Second World War, having been hit by shrapnel in June 1944 some three weeks into the invasion of Normandy.  He had  been an active runner since his school days at Sedbergh School in Yorkshire.  After demob he resumed running on the Common to strengthen his lungs that had been damaged by shrapnel.  He ran in the first London to Brighton Road Race in September 1951.

Before the present changing facilities were made ready for use by Arthur, several runners used to change in the then garage of the first cottage, wash in his bath and have tea and biscuits in his sitting room.  He took a group of runners to the Olympic Games in Rome in 1960 in his Dormobile which seated six.  A number of world record holders, including Gordon Pirie, Dave Bedford and Steve Ovett, have run from Lauriston Cottage.

Arthur died in 2003 aged ninety, and it is thanks to his munificence, and love and encouragement of running and runners that members of the Club enjoy the facilities now.

### Christmas Day Paarlauf (30 minutes)

The Paarlauf (paired run) became popular in Germany shortly after the Second World War.  It was at the suggestion of Charlie Smart, then serving with the Control Commission in Germany, that this annual Christmas Day event was first run in 1954.  It was put on for runners who trained regularly from Lauriston Cottage, not as a serious race, but by way of friendly competition.

Over the following years the Paarlauf became more and more popular, with runners travelling long distances to take part.  There was a feeling within the Club that the event had become too competitive and that the original intention of the race had been forgotten.  The Club therefore decided in 1966, that in future, teams should consist of pairs comprising an “A” runner and a “B” runner, now decided upon by the organisers shortly before the 11a.m. start time.

For the first time since 1954 the 2020 event had to be cancelled owing to the Covid restrictions in force at the time.
