In recent years, several items of New Balance club branded kit were manufactured for members (vests, t-shirts, long-sleeves and leggings). These orders have now been completed. After significant backlogs with the manufacturer, and the impacts of Brexit and Covid, future orders will only be possible in bulk - once 30 items of clothing have been reserved.
