The annual Lauriston garden party for members and their guests will take place on Saturday 4th June, starting at 7:30pm.  
We realise the Jubilee concert is also taking place that evening but could not find a convenient alternative (and unfortunately the Palace could not be persuaded to change their date!)

 
It would be helpful for catering purposes if you could let David Beard know (at secretary@lauristonrunners.club) by 28th May if you are able to come.
