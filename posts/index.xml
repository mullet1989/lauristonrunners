Thanks to all those who helped with the event with special mention to: Ian Isherwood for stepping in at the last moment to organise things in place of Dennis Williams who tested positive for Covid the night before. Ian was ably assisted by Mike Hanahoe, Eric Blackmore, Tom Richards and Jo Wackett (food and mulled wine).
Please find the results on the fixtures page.</description></item><item><title>We have a website now!</title><link>https://www.lauristonrunners.club/posts/01-we-have-a-website/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 20:18:16 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://www.lauristonrunners.club/posts/01-we-have-a-website/</guid><description>The Club - with grateful thanks to Ben Toomer and Matt Sharp - now has a website!
To launch the Clubâ€™s website, we asked member Dave Clarke, a UK international on the country, road and track, 12 time competitor in the World Cross-Championships (best individual finish 7th) and three-time winner of the National Cross-Country Championships, to say briefly what Lauriston Cottage meant to him.
I owe Lauriston Cottage, Arthur Whitehead, and the runners who met there a huge debt of gratitude.</description></item></channel></rss>
