Thanks to all those who helped with the event with special mention to:
Ian Isherwood for stepping in at the last moment to organise things in place of Dennis Williams who tested positive for Covid the night before.   Ian was ably assisted by Mike Hanahoe, Eric Blackmore, Tom Richards and Jo Wackett (food and mulled wine).

Please find the results on the fixtures page.
